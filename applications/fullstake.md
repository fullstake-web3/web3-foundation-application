## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Our product solves the problem of native staking and analysing the whole portfolio within a single interface in DeFi. Based on our research, an average DeFi enthusiast owns 2-3 wallets and 4-5 different tokens. Every PoS chain has its own staking protocol which requires different actions in order to stake. Firstly, this makes staking more than 1 token inconvenient and hardly scalable for the end user. Secondly, having many different platforms for staking makes it impossible to analyse your portfolio’s profitability.

Concept of our product assumes integration of all popular PoS blockhains, including Polkadot, Kusama and all parachains. At the moment, from the user point of view, there are a lot of staking solutions (native, wallets, protocols, CEXs) and more than 100 PoS blockchains, that's exactly why we want to create unique solution for all cases. 

### Project Details

We do have concept prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/Fxsokt9nsc4tqqCVavKsLf/Mockups?page-id=24%3A2&node-id=875%3A712&viewport=335%2C-2155%2C0.47&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=875%3A712

As we call ourselves staking aggregator, we need to integrate different PoS blockchains staking smart contracts. Let's make a quick dive into user point of view about staking: mass users don't really want to know about choosing validators, their uptime and reputation, but they want to track 2 things: 
- How much I invest
- How much I will have in X period after comission 
And of course they want to maximize their profit with minimum risk. That's it, no more details, such as, how to bridge coins into another blockchains and then swap it to stake. 

And here comes our product: 
- convenient, useful and profitable product for users
- helping validators gain more tokens, increasing their efficiency 
- increasing blockchains security and decentralization

We also have pitch deck: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tkX9N1MPkBlO3Zi_7_oWb544peJ5r6yA/view?usp=sharing


We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

I think we answered all questions of this paragraph before, except part about competitors (YieldScan, Kusama Validator Center) 

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Basic functionality

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  1,5
